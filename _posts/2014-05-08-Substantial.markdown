description: Embedded in the Substantial Games team, I handled all marketing responsibilities, leading to a very successful launch weekend where, following very strong Apple support in China, we acquired close to 200,000 players while spending $0 in marketing budget. The Ember Conflict is a now-defunct real-time tactical and strategy game pitting squads of 3 to 6 units against each other in fast-paced, bloody skirmishes.
