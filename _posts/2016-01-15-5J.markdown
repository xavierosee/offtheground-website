description: During my tenure as Head of Marketing at Fifth Journey, I accompanied the CEO and creative teams in defining and executing the marketing strategy for its portfolio of Hollywood IP-related mobile games. I worked hand-in-hand with the production director to set up a comprehensive tech stack across all their titles, allowing the team to operate critical services such as attribution, analytics, community and CRM. In close cooperation with their stakeholders in Hollywood, I devised and executed cross-marketing operations aimed at increasing both game and IP performance. Alongside Kubo a Samurai Quest, I worked on 4 still-unannounced projects (among which VR and AR titles).
