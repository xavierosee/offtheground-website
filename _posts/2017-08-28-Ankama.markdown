description: I worked with the Ankama user acquisition lead to set up and run UA campaigns across various channels. My product vision also led me to advise the development teams in optimizing their games' UX and monetisation. Ankama is a broad transmedia publisher, whose IPs span supports as varied as PC games, animated TV shows, comic books, and board games and merchandising.
